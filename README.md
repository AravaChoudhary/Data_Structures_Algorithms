# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains my journey through learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I aim to build strong foundations in DSA by practicing various problems and sharing solutions here. This collection includes solutions to various DSA problems along with implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++ programming language. This repository aims to showcase my journey in mastering DSA concepts and solving common problems.

## Current Progress
Focusing on solving LeetCode Problems to get more practice and Problem Solving Approach.
### Arrays
I am currently focusing on Array-related problems. Below is a list of problems I have solved so far:
- Key Pair : Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
- Finding Pivot Index: Find an index in an array where the sum of the numbers on the left is equal to the sum of the numbers on the right.
- Shift Array : Shift elements in an array to the left or right by a given number of steps.
- Missing Number : Find the missing number in a sequence of integers from 1 to n.
- Sort 0s and 1s : Sort an array consisting only of 0s and 1s. 

## Learning Resource

I am following the book [Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava, which provides a visual and approachable way to understand algorithms. This book has been instrumental in building my foundational knowledge.
