# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains my journey through learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I aim to build strong foundations in DSA by practicing various problems and sharing solutions here. This collection includes solutions to various DSA problems along with implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++ programming language. This repository aims to showcase my journey in mastering DSA concepts and solving common problems.

## Current Progress
### Arrays
I am currently focusing on Array-related problems. Below is a list of problems I have solved so far:
- Two Sum : Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
- Three Sum : Find three numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
- Shift Array : Shift elements in an array to the left or right by a given number of steps.
- Single Number : Find the single element that appears only once in an array, where every other element appears twice.
- Sort 0s and 1s : Sort an array consisting only of 0s and 1s.


## Learning Resource

I am following the book [Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava, which provides a visual and approachable way to understand algorithms. This book has been instrumental in building my foundational knowledge.
