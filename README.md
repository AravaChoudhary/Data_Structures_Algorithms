# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a reflection of my journey to master DSA concepts and problem-solving skills. It contains:

##### •  Solutions to various DSA problems
##### •  Implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms
##### •  Code written primarily in C++ and also doing in Python.

My goal is to develop strong foundations in DSA by practicing and sharing solutions while continuously improving my problem-solving approach.


## 🚀 Current Progress
I am currently focusing on solving LeetCode Problems to practice and refine my problem-solving skills.

Topics Under Progress:
## 🔎 Pointers
	•	GfG Problems
	•	LeetCode Problems
  •	Binary Search Problems
  •	String Problems

## ✅ Topics Done
    •	Time & Space Complexity
    •	Arrays
    •	Array Related LeetCode Problems
    •	STL (Standard Template Library)
    •	Binary Search & Linear Search 
    •	Strings and Character Arrays


## 📚 Learning Resource

I am following the book [Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava, which provides a visual and approachable way to understand algorithms. This book has been instrumental in building my foundational knowledge.
