# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a reflection of my journey to master DSA concepts and problem-solving skills. It contains:
##### â€¢  Solutions to various DSA problems
##### â€¢  Implementations of core data structures and algorithms
##### â€¢  Code written primarily in C++

My goal is to develop strong foundations in DSA by practicing and sharing solutions while continuously improving my problem-solving approach.

## ðŸš€ Current Progress
I am currently focusing on solving LeetCode Problems to practice and refine my problem-solving skills.

Topics Under Progress:
### ðŸ”Ž Searching
	â€¢	Linear Search
	â€¢	Binary Search
	â€¢	LeetCode Problems


## âœ… Topics Done
    â€¢	Time & Space Complexity
    â€¢	Arrays
    â€¢	Array Related LeetCode Problems
    â€¢	STL (Standard Template Library)


## ðŸ“š Learning Resource

I am following the book [Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava, which provides a visual and approachable way to understand algorithms. This book has been instrumental in building my foundational knowledge.

## ðŸ“Š Leetcode Profile : 
[LeetCode - Aranika4518](https://leetcode.com/u/Aranika4518/)
